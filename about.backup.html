        Hi, I'm Richard Lodder, an NHS senior manager working with a lot of data, exploring how Data Science techniques can help make our processes more effective and efficient.
        Some 24 years ago, I fell in love with coding and statistics whilst at college, and found they were an extension of my obsession with Lego when I was growing up. The ability to build things has always captured my imagination.
        Fast forward to 2020, and I began studying for my MBA, which was a life-changing degree and opened my eyes to all things business management. During this course, I kept asking myself about the data behind the decision-making, particularly during my Operational Mgmt module, which focused heavily on QI methods such as Six Sigma. 
        I graduated in 2022 and began a 12-week intensive Data Science bootcamp, which was amazing. I hadn't coded since attempting to learn C at college, and Python was completely new to me.
        At times, it was frustrating, but when it clicks, it really clicks. From that first where/for loop, to learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning.
        Upon completing the course with 96% (honestly, I don't know how!) I felt a huge gap, and it became clear I was now obsessed with learning, so in 2023 I embarked on my next journey: my MSc in Data Science/Computer Science.
        Fast forward another 2 years, and I graduated with Distinction and have a portfolio of Data Science projects.

        I don't know where my journey will take me next, but I'm excited to find out and share it with you. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I hope you find something interesting/useful on my pages. 
        Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn - details below.

        This is my first blog site. I wanted to share my Data Science/SWE journey and connect with like-minded people. I'm currently focused on building practical systems, both in my professional life at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, and as side-projects to continue developing my skills. (My SQL is definitely a work-in-progress!).
        I've chosen to keep this site design minimal - I'll post weekly/fortnightly, following a fairly similar structure for each post.
