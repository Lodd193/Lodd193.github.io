TITLE: Learning React Hooks for State Management

CATEGORY: Learning

READ TIME: 5

LEAD PARAGRAPH:
I spent the week diving into React hooks after struggling with class components.
Hooks promise simpler state management and better code organization. This post
covers what clicked, what confused me, and how I'm using hooks in my projects.


## The Context
I've been building a React dashboard for tracking my learning progress. My
initial version used class components, but the lifecycle methods felt clunky
and the code was getting messy. I decided to refactor using hooks.


## The Investigation
I started with the official React docs and built three small examples:
- A counter using useState
- A data fetch using useEffect
- A theme toggle using useContext

The pattern started making sense after the third example.


## Key Points
- useState replaces this.state and this.setState
- useEffect handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions)
- Custom hooks let you extract reusable logic
- Hooks only work in function components


## What I Learned
Hooks aren't just a different syntax - they're a different mental model. Instead
of thinking about lifecycle, I think about effects and dependencies. The learning
curve is real, but the code is cleaner.


## Next Steps
I'm going to refactor my dashboard using hooks and build a custom hook for
API calls. I also want to explore useReducer for more complex state.
