          I built a comprehensive workout tracking Progressive Web App using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Supabase. Here's how I went from concept to a fully-deployed fitness companion with offline support, analytics, and 70+ exercises.
        </p>

        <div class="article__content">
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Like many people trying to stay consistent with fitness, I've struggled to track my workouts effectively to ensure I'm hitting my cardio goals and keeping up with progressive overload in my weightlifting. I'd used various apps before, but they were either too complicated, lacked the features I wanted, or required subscriptions for basic functionality. So I wanted something tailored to my own needs that could:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Log workouts quickly without friction</li>
            <li>Track progress over time and provide useful visualisations</li>
            <li>Work offline for those holiday hotel gyms where signal is poor</li>
            <li>Show my personal records and help me to track achievements</li>
            <li>Provide templates for common workout routines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            More importantly, I wanted to build something real that combined my skills and showcased frontend development, backend integration, authentication, and data visualisation - all skills that I had developed through my MSc and bootcamp training but needed more real-world/hands-on experience with as that is where the bugs and issues are encountered and the real learning begins.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Building a full-stack application from scratch presented challenges I hadn't tackled before:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>State management complexity:</strong> Managing workout sessions, exercise data, user preferences, and real-time updates across multiple components</li>
            <li><strong>Offline functionality:</strong> Ensuring the app worked without internet and synced properly when reconnected</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication & security:</strong> Implementing proper user authentication while ensuring data privacy (users should only see their own workouts)</li>
            <li><strong>Data modelling:</strong> Designing a database schema that could handle flexible workout tracking (different exercises, varying sets/reps, cardio vs strength)</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Web App setup:</strong> Making it installable and work like a native app across devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I also needed to decide on a tech stack that would be modern and - something I could actually deploy myself.
          </p>

          <h2>Investigation & Planning</h2>

          <h3>Technology Choices</h3>
          <p>
            After researching options, I settled on a stack that balanced power with experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Next.js 16 & React 19:</strong> Server-side rendering, excellent developer experience, and built-in API routes</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> Type safety to catch errors early and improve code quality (My TS skills are nowhere near my Python skills currently, this was a steep learning curve)</li>
            <li><strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> Rapid UI development with utility classes</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication, real-time subscriptions, and Row Level Security (RLS)</li>
            <li><strong>Vercel:</strong> Easy deployment with automatic HTTPS and global CDN</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supabase was a game-changer because it gave me a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time capabilities without requiring me to set up my own backend infrastructure. This likely saved tens of hours of work.
          </p>

          <h3>Feature Planning</h3>
          <p>
            I broke down the MVP into core features:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>User authentication (sign up, login, password reset)</li>
            <li>Exercise library (70+ exercises across 14 categories)</li>
            <li>Workout logging (sets, reps, weight)</li>
            <li>Progress tracking (personal records, workout history)</li>
            <li>Basic analytics (calendar heat map, streak tracking)</li>
            <li>PWA capabilities (offline support, installable)</li>
            <li>Repeatability & Progression - ensuring it was super simple to repeat a workout template and receive tailored feedback on what to do to improve on the previous session</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Implementation</h2>

          <h3>Database Design</h3>
          <p>
            I designed the Supabase database schema with three main tables:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>users</code> - User profiles linked to Supabase Auth</li>
            <li><code>workouts</code> - Individual workout sessions with date and user reference</li>
            <li><code>exercises</code> - Exercise entries within workouts (sets, reps, weight)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The key insight was to use <strong>Row Level Security</strong> (RLS) policies to ensure users could access only their own data. This meant I didn't need complex backend permissions logic—the database enforced isolation automatically.
          </p>

          <h3>Authentication Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Supabase Auth handled the heavy lifting, but I needed to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an authentication context to manage user state across the app</li>
            <li>Implement protected routes with middleware to redirect unauthenticated users</li>
            <li>Handle session persistence and automatic token refresh</li>
            <li>Add email confirmation for new signups</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The middleware pattern in Next.js 16 made route protection elegant—any route under <code>/dashboard</code> automatically requires authentication.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Clean authentication interface powered by Supabase Auth</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Workout Logging Interface</h3>
          <p>
            The logging interface needed to be fast and intuitive. I built it with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Category selection:</strong> Users pick a muscle group (Chest, Back, Legs, etc.) or cardio type</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise selection:</strong> Filtered list of relevant exercises</li>
            <li><strong>Set entry:</strong> Quick add/remove sets with reps and weight tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Personal record indicators:</strong> 🏆 badges automatically appear when a new PR is achieved</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Real-time PR detection was particularly satisfying - I calculate 1RM estimates using the Epley formula and compare against historical data as users log sets.
          </p>

              <figcaption>Smart guidance for progressive overload based on performance</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>Analytics & Visualisations</h3>
          <p>
            I implemented several analytics features to keep users motivated:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Calendar heat map:</strong> GitHub-style grid showing workout consistency over time</li>
            <li><strong>Streak tracking:</strong> Current and longest workout streaks</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly cardio progress:</strong> Visual progress toward the 150-minute weekly goal</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise history:</strong> Per-exercise progress charts showing weight/reps over time</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The heat map was the most complex—I had to aggregate workout data by date, handle time zone differences, and render a dynamic grid that responds to the current year and month.
          </p>

          <h3>Progressive Web App Setup</h3>
          <p>
            Making it a PWA involved:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Creating a service worker for offline caching</li>
            <li>Adding a web app manifest with icons and theme colours</li>
            <li>Implementing offline detection and sync queue</li>
            <li>Optimising for mobile performance</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The offline functionality was crucial as workouts logged without internet are queued locally and automatically sync when connectivity returns. This required state management to handle the pending uploads and conflict resolution.
          </p>

          <h3>Templates System</h3>
          <p>
            To speed up logging, I added workout templates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-made routines:</strong> PPL (Push/Pull/Legs), Upper/Lower, Full Body, Bro Split, Starting Strength</li>
            <li><strong>Custom templates:</strong> Users can save their own favourite workout combinations</li>
            <li><strong>One-click loading:</strong> Templates populate the logging interface instantly</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This was a huge time-saver for recurring workouts - no more manually selecting the same exercises every session and I ensured these were saved on SupaBase rather than Local Storage to ensure they would be available on any device.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Pre-built workout templates for quick session starts</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>

          <h3>Challenge 1: TypeScript Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript was new to me, and I initially struggled with complex type definitions, especially around Supabase query responses and React component props.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I learned to use TypeScript's utility types (<code>Partial</code>, <code>Pick</code>, <code>Omit</code>) and created shared interface definitions in a <code>types</code> directory. The investment paid off, and type errors caught bugs before runtime. Coming from Python, this was a steep learning curve.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 2: Real-Time Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Getting Supabase real-time subscriptions to work reliably was tricky, especially managing subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I used React's <code>useEffect</code> cleanup functions properly and ensured subscriptions were tied to the component lifecycle. I also added manual refresh buttons as a fallback.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 3: Mobile Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Initial load times on mobile were slower than I wanted, especially with the exercise library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented code splitting, lazy-loaded heavy components, and moved the exercise library to a static JSON file rather than querying the database every time. This reduced the initial bundle size significantly.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>

          <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-stack development:</strong> Connecting frontend UI to backend database with authentication</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript proficiency:</strong> Writing type-safe code and understanding generics</li>
            <li><strong>Database design:</strong> Normalization, relationships, and security policies</li>
            <li><strong>PWA implementation:</strong> Service workers, caching strategies, and offline-first design</li>
            <li><strong>State management:</strong> Using React Context effectively for global state</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Environment variables, CI/CD with Vercel, and production monitoring</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Product & UX Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Friction matters:</strong> Every extra tap or screen reduces usage. The logging flow needed to be seriously optimised.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual feedback is motivating:</strong> The PR badges and streak tracking were fulfilling.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline support is non-negotiable:</strong> An app that doesn't work offline would be useless in this context.</li>
            <li><strong>Templates save time:</strong> Users don't want to think about what to log - they want to start lifting and know the sets/reps/weight to use for progressive overload.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Workflow Improvements</h3>
          <p>
            This was my first project using a component-driven dev approach. Breaking the UI into small, reusable components made debugging easier and sped up feature development. I also learned the value of thoroughly testing authentication flows - auth bugs are a nightmare and sapped many hours of my time.
          </p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The Workout Tracker is now live and deployed. The app successfully:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Works offline with automatic sync</li>
            <li>✅ Installs as a PWA on mobile and desktop</li>
            <li>✅ Tracks 70+ exercises across 14 categories</li>
            <li>✅ Calculates personal records in real-time</li>
            <li>✅ Visualises progress with heat maps and charts</li>
            <li>✅ Secures user data with RLS and authentication</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            More importantly, I use it myself every workout. It's proven that I can take a project from idea to production deployment, which was a major confidence boost as everyone in the tech world seems to be a super-expert with many years of experience doing everything, or at least that's how I perceived it.
          </p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>
            While the core app is complete, there are features I'd like to add:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Exercise videos/GIFs:</strong> Form demonstrations for each exercise</li>
            <li><strong>Workout notes:</strong> Add text notes to sessions (energy levels, injuries, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Data export:</strong> Download workout history as CSV</li>
            <li><strong>Social features:</strong> Optional workout sharing or challenge friends</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced analytics:</strong> Volume load over time, muscle group balance, recovery patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile app:</strong> Native iOS/Android apps using React Native</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The codebase is also a useful foundation for future full-stack projects. I've learned patterns I can reuse, and I'm much more confident with TypeScript, Next.js, and Supabase (I didn't even know Supabase existed before this project!)
          </p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with MVP:</strong> I could have added dozens more features initially, but creating something usable first was the right call - iterative improvements are the way to go. Map out your ideas - the 1) What, 2) Why, 3) How, 4) When, before you write any code. An project plan template is free to use on the Resources page</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript is worth it:</strong> The learning curve was steep, but type safety caught so many bugs, and it's a very in-demand skill right now.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase accelerates development:</strong> Not having to build authentication and database infrastructure saved weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Real projects teach more than tutorials:</strong> Hitting unexpected problems and solving them built real skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Deploy early, iterate often:</strong> Getting it live - even imperfect - forced me to polish rough edges.</li>
          </ol>
