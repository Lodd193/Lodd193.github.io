        <p class="article__lead">
          I built a comprehensive workout tracking Progressive Web App using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Supabase. Here's how I went from concept to a fully-deployed fitness companion with offline support, analytics, and 70+ exercises.
        </p>

        <div class="article__content">
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Like many people trying to stay consistent with fitness, I struggled to track my workouts effectively. I'd used various apps before, but they were either too complicated, lacked the features I wanted, or required premium subscriptions for basic functionality. I wanted something tailored to my needs that could:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Log workouts quickly without friction</li>
            <li>Track progress over time with meaningful visualisations</li>
            <li>Work offline at the gym where signal is poor</li>
            <li>Show personal records and celebrate achievements</li>
            <li>Provide templates for common workout routines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            More importantly, I wanted to build something real that combined frontend development, backend integration, authentication, and data visualisation—all skills I was developing through my MSc and bootcamp training.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Building a full-stack application from scratch presented several challenges I hadn't tackled before:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>State management complexity:</strong> Managing workout sessions, exercise data, user preferences, and real-time updates across multiple components</li>
            <li><strong>Offline functionality:</strong> Ensuring the app worked without internet and synced properly when reconnected</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication & security:</strong> Implementing proper user authentication while ensuring data privacy (users should only see their own workouts)</li>
            <li><strong>Data modelling:</strong> Designing a database schema that could handle flexible workout tracking (different exercises, varying sets/reps, cardio vs strength)</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Web App setup:</strong> Making it installable and work like a native app across devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I also needed to decide on a tech stack that would be modern, scalable, and—critically—something I could actually deploy without managing servers myself.
          </p>

          <h2>Investigation & Planning</h2>

          <h3>Technology Choices</h3>
          <p>
            After researching various options, I settled on a stack that balanced power with developer experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Next.js 16 & React 19:</strong> Server-side rendering, excellent developer experience, and built-in API routes</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> Type safety to catch errors early and improve code quality</li>
            <li><strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> Rapid UI development with utility classes</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication, real-time subscriptions, and Row Level Security (RLS)</li>
            <li><strong>Vercel:</strong> Seamless deployment with automatic HTTPS and global CDN</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supabase was a game-changer—it gave me a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time capabilities without needing to set up my own backend infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h3>Feature Planning</h3>
          <p>
            I broke down the MVP into core features:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>User authentication (sign up, login, password reset)</li>
            <li>Exercise library (70+ exercises across 14 categories)</li>
            <li>Workout logging (sets, reps, weight)</li>
            <li>Progress tracking (personal records, workout history)</li>
            <li>Basic analytics (calendar heat map, streak tracking)</li>
            <li>PWA capabilities (offline support, installable)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Implementation</h2>

          <h3>Database Design</h3>
          <p>
            I designed the Supabase database schema with three main tables:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>users</code> - User profiles linked to Supabase Auth</li>
            <li><code>workouts</code> - Individual workout sessions with date and user reference</li>
            <li><code>exercises</code> - Exercise entries within workouts (sets, reps, weight)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The key insight was using <strong>Row Level Security</strong> (RLS) policies to ensure users could only access their own data. This meant I didn't need complex backend permissions logic—the database enforced isolation automatically.
          </p>

          <h3>Authentication Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Supabase Auth handled the heavy lifting, but I needed to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an authentication context to manage user state across the app</li>
            <li>Implement protected routes with middleware to redirect unauthenticated users</li>
            <li>Handle session persistence and automatic token refresh</li>
            <li>Add email confirmation for new signups</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The middleware pattern in Next.js 16 made route protection elegant—any route under <code>/dashboard</code> automatically requires authentication.
          </p>

          <h3>Workout Logging Interface</h3>
          <p>
            The logging interface needed to be fast and intuitive. I built it with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Category selection:</strong> Users pick a muscle group (Chest, Back, Legs, etc.) or cardio type</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise selection:</strong> Filtered list of relevant exercises</li>
            <li><strong>Set entry:</strong> Quick add/remove sets with reps and weight tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Personal record indicators:</strong> 🏆 badges automatically appear when a new PR is achieved</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Real-time PR detection was particularly satisfying—I calculate 1RM estimates using the Epley formula and compare against historical data as users log sets.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics & Visualisations</h3>
          <p>
            I implemented several analytics features to keep users motivated:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Calendar heat map:</strong> GitHub-style grid showing workout consistency over time</li>
            <li><strong>Streak tracking:</strong> Current and longest workout streaks</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly cardio progress:</strong> Visual progress toward the 150-minute weekly goal</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise history:</strong> Per-exercise progress charts showing weight/reps over time</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The heat map was the most complex—I had to aggregate workout data by date, handle different time zones, and render a dynamic grid that responds to the current year and month.
          </p>

          <h3>Progressive Web App Setup</h3>
          <p>
            Making it a PWA involved:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Creating a service worker for offline caching</li>
            <li>Adding a web app manifest with icons and theme colours</li>
            <li>Implementing offline detection and sync queue</li>
            <li>Optimising for mobile performance</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The offline functionality was crucial—workouts logged without internet are queued locally and automatically sync when connectivity returns. This required careful state management to handle pending uploads and conflict resolution.
          </p>

          <h3>Templates System</h3>
          <p>
            To speed up logging, I added workout templates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-made routines:</strong> PPL (Push/Pull/Legs), Upper/Lower, Full Body, Bro Split, Starting Strength</li>
            <li><strong>Custom templates:</strong> Users can save their own favourite workout combinations</li>
            <li><strong>One-click loading:</strong> Templates populate the logging interface instantly</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This was a huge time-saver for recurring workouts—no more manually selecting the same exercises every session.
          </p>

          <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>

          <h3>Challenge 1: TypeScript Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript was new to me, and I initially struggled with complex type definitions, especially around Supabase query responses and React component props.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I learned to use TypeScript's utility types (<code>Partial</code>, <code>Pick</code>, <code>Omit</code>) and created shared interface definitions in a <code>types</code> directory. The investment paid off—type errors caught bugs before runtime.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 2: Real-Time Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Getting Supabase real-time subscriptions to work reliably was tricky, especially managing subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I used React's <code>useEffect</code> cleanup functions properly and ensured subscriptions were tied to component lifecycle. I also added manual refresh buttons as a fallback.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 3: Mobile Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Initial load times on mobile were slower than I wanted, especially with the exercise library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented code splitting, lazy-loaded heavy components, and moved the exercise library to a static JSON file rather than querying the database every time. This reduced initial bundle size significantly.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>

          <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-stack development:</strong> Connecting frontend UI to backend database with authentication</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript proficiency:</strong> Writing type-safe code and understanding generics</li>
            <li><strong>Database design:</strong> Normalization, relationships, and security policies</li>
            <li><strong>PWA implementation:</strong> Service workers, caching strategies, and offline-first design</li>
            <li><strong>State management:</strong> Using React Context effectively for global state</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Environment variables, CI/CD with Vercel, and production monitoring</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Product & UX Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Friction matters:</strong> Every extra tap or screen reduces usage. The logging flow needed to be ruthlessly optimised.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual feedback is motivating:</strong> The PR badges and streak tracking created genuine excitement.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline support is non-negotiable:</strong> Gyms have terrible signal. An app that doesn't work offline is useless in this context.</li>
            <li><strong>Templates save time:</strong> Users don't want to think about what to log—they want to start lifting.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Workflow Improvements</h3>
          <p>
            This was my first project using a component-driven development approach. Breaking the UI into small, reusable components made debugging easier and sped up feature development. I also learned the value of testing authentication flows thoroughly—auth bugs are the worst kind of bugs.
          </p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            Gym Bestie is now live and deployed. The app successfully:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Works offline with automatic sync</li>
            <li>✅ Installs as a PWA on mobile and desktop</li>
            <li>✅ Tracks 70+ exercises across 14 categories</li>
            <li>✅ Calculates personal records in real-time</li>
            <li>✅ Visualises progress with heat maps and charts</li>
            <li>✅ Secures user data with RLS and authentication</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            More importantly, I use it myself every workout. It's proven that I can take a project from idea to production deployment, which was a major confidence boost.
          </p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>
            While the core app is complete, there are features I'd like to add:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Exercise videos/GIFs:</strong> Form demonstrations for each exercise</li>
            <li><strong>Workout notes:</strong> Add text notes to sessions (energy levels, injuries, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Data export:</strong> Download workout history as CSV</li>
            <li><strong>Social features:</strong> Optional workout sharing or challenge friends</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced analytics:</strong> Volume load over time, muscle group balance, recovery patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile app:</strong> Native iOS/Android apps using React Native</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The codebase is also a great foundation for future full-stack projects. I've learned patterns I can reuse, and I'm much more confident with TypeScript, Next.js, and Supabase.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with MVP:</strong> I could have added dozens more features initially, but shipping something usable first was the right call.</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript is worth it:</strong> The learning curve was steep, but type safety caught so many bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase accelerates development:</strong> Not having to build authentication and database infrastructure saved weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Real projects teach more than tutorials:</strong> Hitting unexpected problems and solving them built real skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Deploy early, iterate often:</strong> Getting it live—even imperfect—forced me to polish rough edges.</li>
          </ol>
