        <p class="article__lead">
          GitHub has a lot of 'hidden' features, it's way more than what I first thought it was - a place to stash my code. While building my workout tracker, I looked into these features a lot and discovered DevOps! I quickly learned how powerful GitHub's project management and DevOps features are. Here's what worked, what I made a huge mess of, and what I'd do differently next time.
        </p>

        <div class="article__content">
          <h2>Why GitHub for Project Management?</h2>
          <p>
            When I started the workout tracker project, I knew I needed version control - I constantly made small iterative changes/improvements based on my own feedback from testing my app at the gym. What I didn't realise was how much GitHub could help me stay organised, track progress, and maintain the quality of my code throughout development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming from a business background with my MBA, I am very familiar with project management principles, but applying them to software development was new to me GitHub's tools really helped to bridge that gap.
          </p>

          <h2>Version Control: The Foundation</h2>

          <h3>Commits as Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Early on, I made the mistake of writing vague commit messages like "fixed stuff" or "updates". This came back to haunt me when I needed to track down when a bug was introduced - similar to my early Python days when I didn't comment on my code and when I created monolithic blocks of code which I couldn't understand when I revisited them weeks or months later.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned to write super descriptive commit messages that explain the "why", not just the "what":
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Before:</strong> "update auth"</li>
            <li><strong>After:</strong> "Add email confirmation to prevent spam signups"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This new found discipline made it a lot easier to understand my project's history and debug issues weeks later.
          </p>

          <h3>Branching Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            I adopted a simple branching strategy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>main</code> - Production-ready code only</li>
            <li><code>dev</code> - Integration branch for features</li>
            <li><code>feature/*</code> - Individual features (e.g., <code>feature/workout-templates</code>)</li>
            <li><code>fix/*</code> - Bug fixes (e.g., <code>fix/pr-calculation</code>)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This kept my main branch stable and allowed me to experiment with new features without breaking my working code (I used to break my working code constantly - honestly, version control is a life saver and something I wish I had learnt on day 1 of my data science journey). When a feature was ready, I'd merge it to <code>dev</code> for testing, then to <code>main</code> for deployment.
          </p>

          <h2>Pull Requests: Code Review for Solo Developers</h2>
          <p>
            Even though I was working solo, I still used pull requests. This might seem excessive, but it helped me learn and feel comfortable using these commands and it forced me to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Review my own code with fresh eyes before merging</li>
            <li>Write a summary of what I'd changed and why</li>
            <li>Check that tests still passed</li>
            <li>Catch bugs I'd missed during development</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The act of writing a PR description made me think critically about whether my implementation was actually solving the problem correctly (the MBA came into play here).
          </p>

          <h2>Issues: Tracking Features and Bugs</h2>
          <p>
            I used GitHub Issues as my personal backlog:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Feature requests:</strong> "Add workout templates for common routines"</li>
            <li><strong>Bugs:</strong> "Personal records not calculating for cardio exercises"</li>
            <li><strong>Enhancements:</strong> "Improve mobile performance on exercise selection"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I labelled issues by type (bug, enhancement, feature) and priority (high, medium, low). This helped me focus on what mattered most and avoid scope creep.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I fixed an issue, I'd reference it in my commit message (<code>Fixes #12</code>), which automatically closed the issue and created a link between the commit and the problem it solved.
          </p>

          <h2>GitHub Projects: Visual Progress Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            I created a GitHub Project board with three columns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>To Do:</strong> Features and fixes I planned to work on</li>
            <li><strong>In Progress:</strong> What I was actively developing</li>
            <li><strong>Done:</strong> Completed and merged work</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Dragging cards across the board gave me a visual sense of progress and helped me avoid taking on too many tasks at once, something I used to do a lot. It also made it easy to see what I'd accomplished over time, which helped me stay motivated.
          </p>

          <h2>GitHub Actions: Automated Workflows</h2>
          <p>
            This is where things got really interesting. I began learning about GitHub Actions and using it to automate repetitive tasks:
          </p>

          <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
          <p>
            I created a workflow that ran on every push to check:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>TypeScript compilation (no type errors)</li>
            <li>Linting (code style consistency)</li>
            <li>Tests (all passing)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This caught errors before they reached production and gave me confidence that my code was solid - I can't begin to tell you how much of a game-changer this is! Everyone who is setting out on their coding journey should learn this asap - it'll change your life.
          </p>

          <h3>Automated Deployments</h3>
          <p>
            I also connected my GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments. Every commit to <code>main</code> triggered a production deploy, and every PR created a preview deployment with a unique URL.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was game-changing - I could test features in a production-like environment before merging, and I always knew the live site matched what was in my <code>main</code> branch.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>

          <h3>Git Tidyness Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Small, focused commits are easier to understand and revert if needed. Large commits that change 20 files across multiple features are a pain in the @$$ to debug later - just don't do it, work iteratively, it's what GitHub excels at!
          </p>

          <h3>Documentation Through Process</h3>
          <p>
            Good commit messages, PR descriptions, and issue tracking created automatic documentation of my decision-making process. When I returned to the project after a break, I could quickly get back up to speed, and, crucially, if I were to collaborate with anyone, they could pick up where I left off. Imagine working with someone in a different timezone, you go to bed, and they wake up. The project you're working on starts seeing progress over a much longer window - the possibilities are endless.
          </p>

          <h3>Automation Saves Time</h3>
          <p>
            Setting up GitHub Actions took a few hours and mainly consisted of watching YouTube videos ("Techworld with Nana" was super helpful). Still, it saved me countless hours of manual testing and deployment. The initial investment paid off right away
          </p>

          <h3>Solo Doesn't Mean Sloppy</h3>
          <p>
            Using professional workflows (branches, PRs, code review), even as a solo developer, prepared me for collaborative work and kept my codebase maintainable.
          </p>

          <h2>What I'd Do Differently</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with issues earlier:</strong> I wrote a lot of code before creating issues to track it. Starting with issues would have helped me plan better.</li>
            <li><strong>Use templates:</strong> GitHub lets you create templates for issues and PRs. This would have saved time and ensured consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Set up branch protection:</strong> I could have required PR reviews (even self-reviews) and passing tests before merging to <code>main</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Tag releases:</strong> I should have used Git tags to mark significant versions (v1.0, v1.1, etc.) for easier rollback if needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tools I Used</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Git CLI:</strong> For commits, branches, and merges</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub Web UI:</strong> For PRs, issues, and project boards</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub Desktop:</strong> Occasionally, for visualising complex merge conflicts</li>
            <li><strong>VS Code Git integration:</strong> For quick staging and committing during development</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Version control is more than backup:</strong> It's a complete project management system when used properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Process scales:</strong> Good habits on solo projects translate directly to team environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation is powerful:</strong> GitHub Actions can handle testing, deployment, and more - freeing you to focus on building.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation happens naturally:</strong> When you commit, review, and track issues properly, you're creating project documentation without extra effort.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            GitHub transformed from "just a code host" into my complete DevOps platform. Whether you're building a personal project or working on a team, these workflows will keep you organised and productive.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're new to GitHub project management, start simple: write better commit messages, create a few issues, and try using a project board. You'll be surprised how much clearer your development process becomes.
