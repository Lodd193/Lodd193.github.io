      <h1>My first GitHub Pages site</h1>

      <p>
        I wanted a simple home for my tech notes. No platform, no accounts for readers,
        no friction. Just a clean site that updates when I commit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The context</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been learning across a few areas at once and I needed somewhere to capture
        progress properly. Not polished tutorials. Not a stream of half-thoughts.
        Just short write-ups that I can come back to later.
      </p>

      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>
        The confusing bit wasn’t “how to make a website”. It was GitHub itself.
        Repositories, commits, branches, and why a file name like <strong>index.html</strong>
        matters. I could feel I was one small detail away from it working, but the details
        were exactly what I didn’t know yet.
      </p>

      <h2>The investigation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I checked what GitHub Pages actually serves by default.</li>
        <li>I looked at where the Pages settings point to: branch and folder.</li>
        <li>I verified the files existed in the right place and were named correctly.</li>
        <li>I refreshed a few times and learnt the hard truth about browser caching.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The fix</h2>
      <p>
        The fix was simple once I stopped guessing and followed the flow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create <strong>index.html</strong> in the repo root.</li>
        <li>Enable Pages in <strong>Settings → Pages</strong> and deploy from the <strong>main</strong> branch root.</li>
        <li>Add a stylesheet and link it properly.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The key line that made styling work was:
      </p>
      <pre style="border:1px solid var(--border); background: rgba(255,255,255,.02); padding: 14px; border-radius: 12px; overflow:auto;"><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;</code></pre>

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub Pages is predictable. It only feels mysterious when you don’t know what it expects.</li>
        <li>File names and locations matter. A missing <strong>index.html</strong> is enough to make everything look broken.</li>
        <li>Commits are basically “save points” for your site. Commit equals deploy.</li>
        <li>If a change doesn’t show, it’s usually caching or the Pages build still catching up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next time</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I’ll add pages deliberately instead of linking to pages that don’t exist.</li>
        <li>I’ll keep the structure consistent so writing stays easy.</li>
        <li>I’ll treat the site as a system, not a one-off task.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next step</h2>
      <p>
        I’m going to publish my next post using the same structure, then improve the Posts page
        so it lists posts cleanly as the site grows.
