        I wanted a simple option to document my tech journey - honing my SQL and Python DS/ML skills, and learning Node.js & React. GitHub Pages was the best option because it didn't require setup on another platform and made it easy to share my project updates.
      </p>
      
      <div class="article__content">
        <h2>The context</h2>
        <p>
          I've been learning across a few areas at once and I needed somewhere to capture progress properly. Not polished tutorials. Not a stream of half-thoughts. Just short write-ups that I can come back to later.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          The confusing bit wasn't "how to make a website". It was GitHub itself. Repositories, commits, branches, and why a file name like <code>index.html</code> matters. I could feel I was one small detail away from it working, but the details were exactly what I didn't know yet.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The investigation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I checked what GitHub Pages actually serves by default.</li>
          <li>I looked at where the Pages settings point to: branch and folder.</li>
          <li>I verified the files existed in the right place and were named correctly.</li>
          <li>I refreshed a few times and learnt the hard truth about browser caching.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The fix</h2>
        <p>The fix was simple once I stopped guessing and followed the flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create <code>index.html</code> in the repo root.</li>
          <li>Enable Pages in Settings → Pages and deploy from the main branch root.</li>
          <li>Add a stylesheet and link it properly.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The key line that made styling work was:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;</code></pre>
        
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub Pages is predictable. It only feels mysterious when you don't know what it expects.</li>
          <li>File names and locations matter. A missing <code>index.html</code> is enough to make everything look broken.</li>
          <li>Commits are basically "save points" for your site. Commit equals deploy.</li>
          <li>If a change doesn't show, it's usually caching or the Pages build still catching up.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Next time</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I'll add pages deliberately instead of linking to pages that don't exist.</li>
          <li>I'll keep the structure consistent so writing stays easy.</li>
          <li>I'll treat the site as a system, not a one-off task.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Next step</h2>
        <p>
          I'm going to publish my next post using the same structure, then improve the Posts page so it lists posts cleanly as the site grows.
