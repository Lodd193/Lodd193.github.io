## Tips for Sustainability

1. **Write when you learn** - Document in real-time, not weeks later
2. **Lower the bar** - 400 words of real insight > 2000 words of filler
3. **Batch similar tasks** - Write multiple drafts, then edit all at once
4. **Use the template** - Don't reinvent structure each time
5. **Schedule writing time** - Block 2 hours on your calendar weekly
6. **Don't wait for perfect** - Published and imperfect > unpublished and perfect

---

## Review & Adjust

**Monthly:** Review posting consistency and adjust cadence if needed
**Quarterly:** Assess if categories/structure still make sense
**Yearly:** Major review of format, goals, and approach
